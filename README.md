## 🏗️ Portfolio Architecture

**My projects form an interconnected ML ecosystem, not isolated demos:**

![Portfolio Architecture](images/portfolio-architecture.png)

*This diagram illustrates how my 15+ projects connect: from data foundation (UCI HAR 10k+ samples, Federal Economic Data) through AI-powered strategic pillars (MotionInsight, Game Theory, Career Intelligence) to production-deployed applications (Streamlit dashboards serving real users), all orchestrated by cost-effective local LLM infrastructure.*

### Architecture Highlights:
- **Data Foundation:** UCI HAR Dataset (10k+ samples), Federal Economic Data, Portfolio & Resume Data
- **Strategic AI Pillars:** MotionInsight (Entropy-Complexity), Game Theory (Nash Equilibrium), Career Intelligence (Archetype Matching)
- **Deployed Applications:** Production Streamlit/React dashboards serving 1000+ users
- **Infrastructure:** Ollama/Local LLMs (Llama 3, Mistral) reducing API costs by 90%
- **Cross-Project Synergy:** Agent orchestration enabling reusable ML components
