# IMPORTANT: Add Your Architecture Diagram

Your enhanced README is ready and references this image:
`images/portfolio-architecture.png`

## How to Add the Diagram:

1. Save the architecture diagram you showed me to your Desktop
2. Name it: `portfolio-architecture.png`
3. Copy it to this folder:
   ```bash
   cp ~/Desktop/portfolio-architecture.png ~/Documents/rosalinatorres888/images/
   ```
4. Then run:
   ```bash
   cd ~/Documents/rosalinatorres888
   git add images/portfolio-architecture.png
   git commit -m "Add portfolio architecture diagram"
   git push origin main
   ```

OR you can add it directly through GitHub's web interface:
1. Go to: https://github.com/rosalinatorres888/rosalinatorres888
2. Click "Add file" → "Upload files"
3. Upload the diagram to `images/` folder
4. Commit

The README will automatically display it once uploaded!
